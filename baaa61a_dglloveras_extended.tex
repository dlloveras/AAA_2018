EUV tomography is routinely applied to data provided by spaceborne telescopes, typically covering the range of heliocentric heights $\approx 1.02-1.25~\rm{R}_\odot$. This range partially overlaps that of the field of view of the white light K-coronagraph (KCOR) instrument, at the High Altitude Observatory (HAO), which covers the range $\approx 1.05-3.0~\rm{R}_\odot$.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

Solar rotational tomography (SRT) was initially developed by \citet{altschuler_1972} for reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the coronal electron density based on white light (WL) data. \citet{frazin_2002} developed a modern, robust, regularized, positive method for tomographic inversion of the coronal electron density from WL data, used in this work. A thorough review on WL tomography can be found in those references.

More recently, \citet{frazin_2009} developed the differential emission measure tomography (DEMT) technique. DEMT combines EUV tomography in several pass-bands with local DEM analysis, to reconstruct the 3D distribution of both the coronal electron density and temperature. A recent review by \citet{vasquez_2016} summarizes the existing solar physics literature based on DEMT analysis. More recent DEMT-based works include \citet{lloveras_2017}, who carried out a comparative analysis of the coronal structure at the solar minima between solar cycles (SC-)22/23 and 23/24.

DEMT research has been carried out based on data provided by several generations of spaceborne EUV telescopes. The latest one is the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument, on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), whose data is used in this work.

While the electron density determined from EUV tomography is dependent on the assumed iron coronal abundance, as well as affected by the so-called coronal filling factor \citep{frazin_2009}, that determined from WL tomography is not \citep{frazin_2010}. So far, no comparison had been carried out between results obtained with both techniques. Here, the tomographic reconstruction of the coronal electron density for a given period is carried out using both methods and their results are compared for the first time.

\section{Data and Methodology}\label{method}

Carrington rotation (CR-)2198 (2017, December 03 UT 14:37 - December 30	UT 22:25) was selected as target for analysis, a relatively quiet rotation in the declining activity phase of SC-24. Low latitudes were dominated by the equatorial streamer belt, with a complex of active regions (ARs) located in the longitude range $\approx 80^\circ-200^\circ$, and high latitudes were dominated by polar coronal holes (CHs),  

The KCOR and AIA images were obtained for the period 2017, December 03 through December 17, providing observations of the off-limb corona at all Carrington longitudes. In the case of AIA, images for all the coronal bands $171, 193, \rm{and}\, 211~\AA$ are obtained every 1 hr, and processed with our own tomography data pre-processing tools, which make use of the SolarSoft AIA software in its latest version. In particular, images are averaged over 6 hr long bins, so that a total of about 55 images are used. In the case of KCOR, one 10-minute average coronal polarized brightness (pB) image for each day, obtained using its best observational window, was requested to the instrument team.

Figure \ref{fig_images} shows examples of the coronal images used for this work. The left panel shows an AIA coronal EUV image taken in its $211~\rm{\AA}$ band. The right panel shows a KCOR coronal pB WL image. Both images were taken nearly-simultaneously on 2017 December 03 UT 18:00-19:00. This is roughly the beginning of CR-2198, so the longitude of the disk center in these images is $\approx 0^\circ$, so the ARs are not seen and the images are dominated by the quiet sun streamer belt and the CHs.

Both the WL and EUV tomographic reconstructions were performed on the same resolution, with computational voxels having uniform radial size of $0.01~\rm{R}_\odot$ and angular size of $2^\circ$ in both latitude and longitude. Solutions were computed with a 3D regularization scheme.

\section{Results}

For the specific data sets of this rotation, the coronal electron density structure was reconstructed in the height range $1.02-1.20~\rm{R}_\odot$ from EUV tomography, and $1.09-1.80~\rm{R}_\odot$ from WL tomography. Figure \ref{fig_maps} shows Carrington maps of both reconstructions at heliocentric height $r=1.105~\rm{R}_\odot$. 

The white boxes in the maps indicate two regions selected for quantitative comparison. The region in the Southern hemisphere is a high-density quiet Sun region within the equatorial streamer belt. The region in the Northern hemisphere is a lower density region at subpolar latitudes in the northern CH.

The quantitative comparison of the electron density determined from both tomographic analysis at each computational voxel of the two selected regions is shown in Figure \ref{fig_analysis}. For each region, the top panel shows the histogram of the ratio of electron density as determined from both tomographic analysis for all voxels within the common reconstructed coronal volume, i.e. in the range of heights $1.09-1.20~\rm{R}_\odot$.
For each region, the bottom panel shows the average radial dependence of the electron density determined from both analysis.

\section{Discussion and Future Work}

The coronal electron density determined from WL tomography is systematically larger than that determined from EUV tomography. The characteristic (median) WL-to-EUV electron density ratio is $\sim 2.0$ in the quiet sun streamer belt region and $\sim 1.6$ in the subpolar region within the CH.

This difference may be partly explained by the fact that the KCOR data is affected by the sky brightness which was not subtracted in the specific data set used for this first work, as the required procedures were being revised by the HAO team at the moment of this analysis. Once applied a sky subtraction, the electron density as determined from WL tomography will systematically decrease. If systematic differences persist they can be attributable to physical factors. 

Firstly, the EUV emissivity determined at each voxel from tomographic analysis is proportional to the local mean squared electron density, i.e. $\Eeuv \propto \AvgNE2 = f\,\AvgNe^2$, where the \emph{filling factor} is here defined as $f\equiv\AvgNE2 / \AvgNe^2 > 1$. As the WL emission is due to Thompson scattering, its voxel emissivity is proportional to the local average electron density, i.e. $\Ewl \propto \AvgNe$. Then: $\AvgNe_{\rm{WL}} / \AvgNe_{\rm{EUV}} \propto \sqrt{f}$. 

If differences in the results are solely attributed to the filling factor $f$, then $f\sim 4.0$ the quiet sun region of the streamer belt, and $f\sim 2.5$ in the subpolar region of the CH. As for any probability distribution, $\SigmaNe^2 \equiv \rm{Var}(N_e) = \AvgNE2 - \AvgNe^2 = \AvgNe^2 \, (f-1)$, then $\SigmaNe / \AvgNe = \sqrt{f-1}$. With this interpretation, where $f$ is larger (quiet sun region) the electron density probability distribution has a larger variance.

Secondly, the EUV emmisivity determined from tomography is proportional to the assumed iron coronal abundance $[\rm{Fe}]$. As a result, the EUV tomography estimate of the average squared electron density scales as $\AvgNE2 \propto 1/[\rm{Fe}]$ \citep{frazin_2009}.

The work here summarized is a first step towards development of a new methodology capable of jointly determining the coronal 3D distribution of the electron density and temperature, as well as the filling factor and iron abundance. The technique, dubbed multi-instrument tomography (MIT) and currently under development, will involve joint analysis of tomographic products based on data provided by multiple instruments. These include white-light coronagraphs, EUV telescopes, and visible emission line coronagraphs. In particular, MIT will attempt to combine KCOR and AIA data, with that to be provided by the (soon to be operative) Upgraded Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (UCoMP) instrument \citep{landi_2016}.
